## Project Concept:
A social storytelling platform. Users can choose time periods from their life and answer the provided question set. Then you can select from the age ranges to view stories other users have submitted at random. All question sets and answers are anonymous currently though username/password are stored encrypted in the database for potential development in the future.

### Project Overview:

Ever wanted to know what other people felt when they were younger? How about what they were afraid of? This site is built to allow users to see the experiences and thougts of the community from their past. Back in my Day gives people the ability to view the world through each other's eyes and share their own unique stories.
